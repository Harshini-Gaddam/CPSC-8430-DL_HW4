This repository tells how to train a discriminator/generator pair on the CIFAR10 dataset utilizing techniques from DCGAN, Wasserstein GANs, and ACGAN GANs.
And in these techniques, generator generates fake images and discriminator detects the real images. Generator and Discriminator losses during training are calculated and plotted for 20000 iterations.
